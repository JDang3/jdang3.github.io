## 学海无涯 (Learning has no boundaries)

In my journey, I've come to believe that determination is the driving force behind every success story. It's the unwavering commitment to learning, the resilience to face challenges, and the refusal to be daunted by the unknown. Whether wrestling with complex mathematical proofs or debugging intricate lines of code, determination has been my steadfast companion.


If you give up then all your efforts is lost

*做人要靠自己，如果你放弃了那就全部的努力就没了*
