## 人比人，比死人 aka 人比人，气死人
You see what other people have, and you want what they've got. However, it turns out it's not the same, and it can never be the same. Sometimes, we keep fighting and won't give up, and maybe you will achieve it, but as you climb higher, there is always someone better. So, you fight again and again. You have to suffer repeatedly, but this time, you're exhausted and beating yourself up because you feel you're not good enough.

You waste a lot of negative energy, and this takes time to recover. If you're able to control this, pause and think back: What was your original objective? Ask yourself if you have progressed toward your objective. Is the objective necessarily meant to make you happy? If it does, then let's explore how we can learn from the best and slowly get there rather than wasting energy on negativity. This, in turn, will put you in a far better position and make you happier than those competing without reason.

Simplified Chinese: 人比人，比死人 *aka* 人比人，气死人\
