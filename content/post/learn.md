## 学海无涯 (Learning has no boundaries)

In my journey, I've come to believe that determination is the driving force behind every success story. It's the unwavering commitment to learning, the resilience to face challenges, and the refusal to be daunted by the unknown. Whether wrestling with complex mathematical proofs or debugging intricate lines of code, determination has been my steadfast companion.

### Meaning of 学海无涯
Simplified Chinese: 学海无涯苦作舟\
Tradtional Chinese: 學海無涯苦作舟

I came across this phrase during my university studies. My Math lecturer shared it with me as a gift during his office hours. The metaphor suggests that learning is akin to sailing on a boat—no matter which path you take, the ocean has no end. This mirrors the idea that in learning, there is no limit, and whichever path you choose, the journey of acquiring knowledge continues indefinitely.

*If you give up, then all your efforts and hardwork will be lost.*\
*做人要靠自己，如果你放弃了那就全部的努力就没了*
