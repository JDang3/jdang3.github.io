## 狗眼看人低 (Belittled)
We cannot stop racism, bullying, or any form of oppression when one uses their power against another. Life is unfair, and humans often find entertainment in it. What’s worse is that when you want to grow, you seek an environment that supports your development. However, you may be belittled, and some people will create obstacles in your journey. You have two choices: stay and prove them wrong or take the easier path by joining a team where you can grow faster. Where would you be more happier?

### Meaning of 狗眼看人低
Simplified Chinese: 狗眼看人低\
Tradtional Chinese: 狗眼看人低

I came across this phrase during my sixth-form studies. I forgot what I did, but my friend and I were discussing something when he suddenly said 狗眼看人低. At the time, I didn’t know what it meant. Trying to decipher it, I initially thought it literally meant a dog's eyes looking down on you. Later, I realized it was a metaphor for being belittled. In reality, this phrase reflects an act of bullying. Dismissing or disrespecting someone’s thoughts implies that you see yourself as superior to them. This kind of naive mindset makes you closed off and unwilling to consider other perspectives, ultimately hindering your future success by limiting your ability to explore all possible paths. We should strive to be more open-minded and respect one another.

*People say bad things or fake things, the more people say it, even fake things can become reality. It's only when you wake up you realise it's all bs.*\
*受了伤 先知道要坚强,受委屈先会学懂原谅*
