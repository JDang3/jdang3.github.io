## 不问就笨 (just ask)

Back in the days when I worked in my family's Chinese takeaway, my dad taught me the phrase 不问就笨, which translates to 'If you don't ask, then you're stupid.' Learning can be exhausting, but if you don't ask, you'll never discover the truth or find the answers to the questions you're curious about.

Simplified Chinese: 不问就笨\
Tradtional Chinese: 不問就笨


*Don't be afraid and just ask*\
*如果你不问，你就不知道答案是什么。。。值得吗？*
