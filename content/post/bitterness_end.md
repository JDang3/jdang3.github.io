## 苦中有一点甜 (Bitterness End)

"No matter who you are or where you are, we all have to go through pain and hard work at some point in life; this could also be a very long journey. But, as they say, **no pain, no gain**. Each and every individual is different, and we all take different times to reach our goals.

This is inspired by one of my close friends: 'Remember, this is your life to live at your own pace. It doesn't really matter how fast you accomplish X and Y because money won't make you happier in the end.'"

### Meaning of 苦中有一点甜
